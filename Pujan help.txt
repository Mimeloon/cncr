You can save the high score in a local text file and write a simple js to update it if the final score is greater than the high score

(((((in html you would list out several questions and similar to a random nmbr generator you use the rand function to display the questions))))

So what you can do is start with a html index page. Have a button which launches another window with the js stuff
